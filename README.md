<center> <h1>PowerTool</h1> </center>

PowerTool retrieves class and grade data from PowerSchool. Among other features, PowerTool retrieves class and grade data and displays it on a minimalistic GUI. After this project reaches 1.0.0, I will have release section on Github and a download link provided. This project was created for learning web scraping among other programming things and I am providing the source code as others may be able to debug similar projects with it.

### Patch Notes for 1.0.1:

- Attempting to delete duplicate branch.

<br />

### Patch Notes for 1.0.0:

- Main project goal complete!
- Fixed grade difference statement. It now displays the difference of your current grades and prior grades of when you clicked run. (It also saves the grade data in a file when the run button has been pressed twice previously so you can get the grade difference when you open PowerTool later!)
- Licensed under MIT License.
- Resolved quarter bugs.
- Improved performance.
